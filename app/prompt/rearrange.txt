Now I want a javascript function named "rearrange" that takes a json object as parameter.
If the object has a field "pop-up" as key, the pop up a message with the value of for that key (will be a plain text).
If the object has a field "pannels" the value of that key will a dictionary, each key name will correspond with the name of a panel, then the value
of asociated to the key will be a number, if the number is 0, hide the whole section with the panel and the panel-header, otherwise the panel-header is visible, 
if the number is 1 contract that pannel like togglePanel does when it is expanded, if the number is 2 expand the panel like togglePanel, note that the previous state of the pannel is unknow, 
for example if the pannel is already extended a value of 2 will have no efect. 
If the objects has a field "re-name" the value for that key will be another dictionary, where each key will correspond to an id of the html 
code and each value will be a text that will replace current text for that id object on the page, allowing this way to transalte the whole page, 
note that panel headers will contain a string without the sign + or - that is used currently to expand or contract, 
but the sign should remind there to help the user to expand or contract.

Document all javascript functions on a different file, name it apropiately

Also I want that when index.html is open if the header of the URL pass as parameter "rearrange_file" the javascript will load the file reference there which by default is located at the folder
test asuming the folder containing index.html is the root. that file will contain a json object that will be read and
